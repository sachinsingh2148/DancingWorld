          To dance means to move the body in a rhythmic fashion. Dancing can be
          done in time to music, but it does not need to be. Dancing is an art
          form: it is designed to look beautiful as well as being meaningful.

          Dance Diaries is a concept and a project founded by Izs√©pi Adrienn and
          Sagar Marktho in 2017. It is an open platform for those, who are
          passionate about art. The project aims to gather talented directors,
          cinematographers, choreographers, dancers, musicians, storytellers,
          and artists, to tell stories through dance and to make something
          special together. The event is about the launch of Dance Diaries and
          to tell more about their journey so far. The aim is to also meet
          artists from different background who would love to collaborate in any
          way, be it content writer, photographer, director, dancers etc. The
          event will also have the screening of videos which were made under
          Dance Diaries banner. This involves showcasing how a concept or a
          story is actually made into a video and what goes behind it. So if you
          are Dance enthusiasts and are looking for projects which are
          unconventional, then this is the event to be. Also artists from
          different backgrounds looking for collaboration to work on various
          innovative projects, we would love to meet and hear you out in the
          event.
